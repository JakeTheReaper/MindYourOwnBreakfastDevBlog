## Welcome to my blog

Before I get started with posting the super cool wicked stuff everyone is dying to read, here’s a quick introduction about myself and what I’m going to write about.

I’m Jake, a 32 year old day dreamer from Sydney, Australia. “Hi Jake”.
I’m currently enrolled in an IT degree with the goal of eventually becoming a web developer. In the past I have dabbled in the dark arts and built some very basic websites but nothing which screams out, “look at this guy with his slick web dev skills”. 

So after a few years of beating round the bush with half-hearted efforts, I’ve decided to get stuck into it and document my journey in the process. Essentially this blog will consist of mainly tech stuff with maybe some random going off on a tangent posts to keep things interesting along with book reviews as I tend to read a lot of books. “What a nerd”.

At this point in time I have decided to focus on Front-End development. For this, I have chosen to learn the ins and out of JavaScript. To give you some insight into my programming prowess, I have only used the following languages for assignments and have unfortunately forgotten about them since. These are:

* Java
* Python
* Perl
* PHP
* HTML, CSS
* Basic JavaScript

The joys of studying where you gain certain knowledge in a specific subject area for a short amount of time, without really getting the chance afterwards to invest some time into solidifying your knowledge. I will write a more in depth post about my thoughts on the tertiary education system in the near future, including all the pros and cons from my experience.

On a side note, I have previously obtained a Diploma in Graphic Design and have worked in the industry albeit for a very brief amount of time. The main positive takeaway I got from that whole experience was when you are thrown in the deep end you learn to swim pretty quickly. You also gain rapid improvement and very sore eyes (from constantly staring at a screen) when you are investing 40+ hours a week honing your skills and mastering your craft. This leads me to the belief that the difference between being good at something and being great is “time”, investing the time in your work and investing the time in yourself. 

If you have made it this far and gotten through all the riff raff then I applaud you and thank you for sticking it out. 

That’s all for now so strap yourself in and join me on this wild journey towards becoming a top notch web developer. 
##Disclaimer: 
It will be a bumpy ride but I can guarantee lots of laughs along the way.
